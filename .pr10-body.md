## What
- Introduced Phase 1 feature folders under src/features/* and shared UI under src/shared/ui.
- Extracted the file explorer UI into src/features/explorer/ExplorerPanel.tsx and wired it into the sidebar in src/App.tsx.
- Added Explorer layering:
  - src/features/explorer/explorer.api.ts: invokeBackend wrapper + formatBackendError for the { ok: true, data } / { ok: false, error } envelope.
  - src/features/explorer/explorer.actions.ts: scanVault + lazy loadDirChildren + createEntry/deleteEntry/renameMarkdown, all calling the API and updating state.
  - src/features/explorer/explorer.store.ts: minimal store via useSyncExternalStore (tree/expandedDirs/loadingDirs/warnings).
- Added schema-only context menu definitions in src/features/explorer/explorer.menus.ts and a reusable renderer in src/shared/ui/ContextMenu.tsx.

## Why
Phase 1 requires landing the new directory skeleton and shrinking the App.tsx  god component. Explorer is the lowest-risk, highest-ROI first extraction: it has relatively low coupling with editor/web, and slimming it out immediately improves modularity.

## Implementation notes
- ExplorerPanel has intentionally minimal props (vaultRoot, openTab(path), activePath) to avoid importing editor/tab stores and reintroducing cross-feature coupling.
- Explorer filesystem IPC now flows through the Explorer API wrapper and actions (scan/create/delete/rename). The UI layer calls explorer.actions.* only; explorer.menus.ts returns schema and contains no side effects.
- Context menu actions currently use prompt/confirm in the panel for simplicity; follow-up work can replace this with a proper modal and add a dirty-state guard.

## Known limitations / follow-ups
- Rename/delete currently do not proactively reconcile already-open markdown tabs; this PR focuses on the extraction and keeping the app stable (no crashes). A proper dirty-guard + tab reconciliation is planned for a later step.

## Testing
- pnpm build
