## What
- Fixes a Windows-only failure when selecting/scanning a vault located on a drive root (e.g. `C:\Users\...`).
- Adds a Windows regression test for the drive-prefix case.
- Updates docs to record the Windows-specific behavior/constraint.

## Why
When choosing a vault on Windows, the backend path security check (`ensure_no_symlink`) walks path components and calls `symlink_metadata` per component. On Windows, probing the bare drive prefix component (e.g. `C:`) can return `os error 1` ("The function is incorrect"), which bubbles up as `Metadata failed` and breaks `scan_vault`, surfacing in the frontend as an unhandled promise rejection.

## Implementation details
- `src-tauri/src/security/path_policy.rs`: `ensure_no_symlink()` now skips `std::path::Component::Prefix(_)` so we only probe concrete filesystem locations (e.g. `C:\`).
- `src-tauri/src/ipc.rs`: derives `Debug` for `ApiError` to support `unwrap()` in tests.
- Windows-only unit test added to prevent regressions.
- Documentation updated to note the Windows drive-prefix behavior.
